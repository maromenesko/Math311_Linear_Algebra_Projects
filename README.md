# Math311 Linear Algebra Projects

This is a repository of projects for the Math 311 linear algebra course at Winona State University. It uses Google CoLab and coding in Python to explore linear algebra concepts.

# Projects

1. Solving Sytems using CoLab and Python.

   In this project, we take a look into how to utilize python to make our lives easier when solving systems of equations.

2. Explore Impact of Eigenvalues for non square matrices

     In this project, we take a look at what part the differing eigenvalues play on the overall outcome of a matrix.

3. Secret Number

     In this project, we are using colab and linear algebra to deeply encode our created polynomial. We then will use the same notebook to try and decode our competitors polyinomal faster than they can crack ours.

4. Ski Hill Transition Matricies and Markov Chains

     In this project, we take a look at building and utilizing transition matricies. We will also show just how to use and interpret them.
